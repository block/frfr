**Context**: The claim below was extracted from a document, but the evidence quote was paraphrased instead of being an exact quote. Your task is to find the EXACT text from the source that supports this claim.

**Claim**: {claim}

**Paraphrased Quote** (NOT exact): {paraphrased_quote}

**Source Context** (Lines {context_start}-{context_end}):
{context}

---

**Your Task**:
1. Search the context above for text that DIRECTLY supports the claim
2. Extract the EXACT quote (word-for-word, verbatim) from the context
3. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or rephrase - copy the exact text
4. Include enough context to make the quote self-contained but stay focused

**Requirements**:
- The quote MUST be verbatim text from the context above
- The quote should be as specific and complete as possible
- Include surrounding context if it helps clarify the fact
- If multiple sentences support the claim, include all of them

**Output Format** (JSON only):
{{
  "found": true/false,
  "exact_quote": "word-for-word text from context (if found)",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "line_hint": "approximate line numbers where quote appears (e.g., 'around lines 105-107')",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of why this quote supports the claim"
}}

If you cannot find supporting text in the context, set found to false.
