Document: {document_name}

Analyze this document deeply and provide a comprehensive summary:

1. **Document Type**: Identify the specific type (SOC2 Type 2 report, penetration test report, architecture design doc, security policy, compliance audit, technical specification, etc.)

2. **Structural Pattern**: Describe HOW the document is organized:
   - Is it claim-based with specific assertions under headings? (e.g., SOC2 with control statements)
   - Is it findings-based with discovered issues? (e.g., pentest with vulnerabilities)
   - Is it procedural with step-by-step processes?
   - Is it descriptive with technical details?
   - What are the repeating structural elements? (controls, findings, requirements, specifications)

3. **Section Types**: Categorize the major section types found (array of section types with their characteristics):
   - System Description sections (organizational/architectural facts)
   - Control Testing sections (technical implementation + test evidence)
   - CUEC sections (customer responsibility facts)
   - Privacy/Confidentiality sections (data handling specifics)
   - Findings/Results sections
   - For each type, note: section_type, characteristics, extraction_priority

4. **Table Structure**: Does this document use tables? If so, describe:
   - Column structure (e.g., "3-column: Control | Test Performed | Results")
   - How to extract from each column separately
   - Example of table content

5. **Section Headings**: List 8-12 major section headings or control categories found in the document

6. **Fact Density Pattern**: What types of factual claims appear repeatedly?
   - Specific controls/requirements being described?
   - Technologies and configurations mentioned?
   - Processes and procedures documented?
   - Compliance statements or assertions?
   - Test results or findings?

7. **Primary Topics**: Main subject areas covered (bullet points)

8. **Key Entities**: Important systems, organizations, technologies, or components

9. **Scope**: Timeframe, systems, boundaries, or coverage

10. **Extraction Guidance**: Based on the document type and structure, what kinds of facts should we prioritize extracting?
   - For SOC2: specific control implementations, technologies used, procedures followed, WHO/WHEN/HOW details
   - For pentest: vulnerabilities found, severity levels, affected systems
   - For architecture: components, data flows, security measures
   - For policies: requirements, responsibilities, enforcement mechanisms

   CRITICAL: Extraction must capture:
   - WHO performs each control (roles/titles)
   - WHEN/HOW OFTEN (frequencies, timeframes)
   - WHAT TOOLS/SYSTEMS (specific technologies, versions)
   - Quantitative values (thresholds, metrics, percentages)
   - Technical specifications (protocols, algorithms, configurations)

CRITICAL EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:

**EXTRACTION PHILOSOPHY**: This system aims to EXCEED human analysis capabilities. Extract facts with MAXIMUM DEPTH and SPECIFICITY. Every distinct technical detail, every specific configuration, every quantitative value, every process step is a separate fact.

Based on the document type ({doc_type}), you should extract MANY facts per chunk. This document follows a {structural_pattern} pattern.

{extraction_guidance}

SPECIFIC FACT TYPES TO EXTRACT:
{fact_density_pattern}

**AGGRESSIVE EXTRACTION MODE** - For this document type, extract:

1. **Specific implementations** - Leave NO technical detail behind
   - Named entities: AWS, AWS RDS, AWS EC2, Splunk Enterprise 9.0, Okta SSO, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, AES-256-GCM, SHA-256, RSA-4096, NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5, ISO 27001:2013, OWASP Top 10, HIPAA, SOX, etc.
   - Extract EVERY technology mentioned, with versions when available
   - Extract EVERY protocol, algorithm, encryption method, key size
   - Extract EVERY third-party tool, vendor name, service provider

2. **Concrete processes** - Extract EVERY process detail
   - WHO: Extract every role, title, team, department, person mentioned (IT manager, Security team, CISO, VP of Engineering, authorized personnel, third-party auditor)
   - WHEN: Extract every frequency, schedule, timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, semi-annually, real-time, within 24 hours, every 90 days)
   - HOW: Extract every procedure, methodology, workflow step (automated script, manual review, ticketing system, approval workflow, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)

3. **Technical details** - Extract EVERY quantitative value
   - Numbers with units: 90 days, 365 days, 256-bit, 4096-bit, 8 characters, 16 characters, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage
   - Percentages: 99.9%, 99.95%, 5% error rate, 80% CPU threshold
   - Frequencies: daily at 2 AM, weekly on Sundays, monthly on first Monday
   - Thresholds: temperature >80°F, <3 failed login attempts, CPU >80%, disk >90%
   - Capacity metrics: RTO of 4 hours, RPO of 15 minutes, 99.95% uptime SLA
   - Temperature ranges, humidity levels, power specifications

4. **Organizational facts** - Extract EVERY organizational detail
   - Team sizes: 8-person IT team, 3 security engineers, 50+ developers
   - Locations: Alpharetta GA, data center in Virginia, office in London
   - Reporting structures: reports to CISO, overseen by Board, managed by VP
   - Responsibilities: responsible for patch management, accountable for backups

5. **Compliance statements** - Extract EVERY compliance detail
   - Standards: meets NIST SP 800-53, follows ISO 27001:2013, complies with GDPR Article 32
   - Certifications: SOC 2 Type 2 certified, PCI DSS Level 1, HIPAA compliant
   - Requirements: required by policy, mandated by regulation, enforced by contract

6. **Test results** - Extract EVERY test detail
   - What was tested: user authentication, firewall rules, backup restoration, disaster recovery plan
   - How it was tested: inspection, observation, inquiry, re-performance, automated testing, manual review
   - Sample sizes: 25 of 100 users, all 50 servers, representative sample of 10%
   - Results: no exceptions noted, 3 deviations found, all tests passed, remediation required

**DEPTH INSTRUCTIONS**:
- If a paragraph describes a control, extract 5-10 distinct facts from it
- If a sentence contains multiple technical details, create a separate fact for each
- If a list has 5 items, create 5 separate facts (one per item)
- Extract facts about the same control at different specificity levels:
  - High-level: "Uses firewalls for network security"
  - Mid-level: "Firewall rules restrict inbound traffic"
  - Detailed: "Firewall configured to allow only ports 80 and 443 for inbound HTTPS traffic with stateful packet inspection"

ENHANCED METADATA EXTRACTION:

For EACH fact, you must also provide:
- **fact_type**: One of: technical_control, organizational, process, metric, CUEC, test_result, architecture, compliance
- **control_family**: One of: access_control, encryption, monitoring, backup_recovery, change_management, incident_response, physical_security, network_security
- **specificity_score**: 0.0-1.0 (0.0=generic "uses firewalls", 1.0=specific "uses Palo Alto PA-5220 firewalls with IDS/IPS enabled")
- **entities**: List of named entities (tools, technologies, protocols, standards) mentioned in this fact
- **quantitative_values**: List of quantitative values (numbers, percentages, timeframes, ranges)
- **process_details**: If this is a process fact, extract: {{"who": "role", "when": "frequency", "how": "procedure"}}
- **section_context**: "{section_context}"
- **related_control_ids**: List of control IDs mentioned (e.g., CC6.1, A.1.2)

SPECIFICITY EXAMPLES:
❌ Low specificity (0.3): "LNRS engineers use several monitoring tools"
✅ High specificity (0.9): "LNRS uses Splunk Enterprise for log aggregation and Datadog for infrastructure monitoring with alerts sent when CPU exceeds 80%"

❌ Low specificity (0.2): "Temperature and humidity levels are monitored"
✅ High specificity (0.9): "Data center temperature maintained at 68°F with alerts triggered at ±5°F variance"

GENERAL RULES:
- Each distinct claim is a separate fact
- DO NOT skip facts because they seem similar - extract all distinct claims
- Prioritize specific, detailed facts over generic statements
- When in doubt, extract it - more facts is better than fewer

**V5: EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS** (CRITICAL):

Each fact must have supporting evidence. You have TWO options:

**Option 1: Single Evidence (most common)**
Use when all evidence is in one place:
```
"evidence_quote": "Exact WORD-FOR-WORD text from chunk"
```

**Option 2: Multiple Evidence (V5 - use when appropriate)**
Use when a fact combines information from different locations:
```
"evidence_quotes": [
  {{
    "quote": "First supporting quote (EXACT text)",
    "source_location": "Lines X-Y",
    "relevance": "What this quote supports (optional)"
  }},
  {{
    "quote": "Second supporting quote (EXACT text)",
    "source_location": "Lines Z-W",
    "relevance": "What this quote supports (optional)"
  }}
]
```

**When to use multiple quotes:**
- Fact mentions frequency from one location AND implementation details from another
- Combining policy statement with implementation evidence
- Multiple test results supporting the same conclusion
- Technology mentioned in one place, configuration in another

**Quote rules (apply to both formats):**
- Copy text WORD-FOR-WORD from the chunk
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or rephrase
- DO NOT change wording, even slightly
- If exact text is unclear, extract a longer quote to be safe

WHAT TO EXTRACT (be extremely thorough):
✓ Specific technology implementations with versions ("uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL 13.7", "configured with Duo MFA", "utilizes Okta SSO")
✓ Security controls with specifics ("firewall rules restrict inbound traffic to ports 80/443", "AES-256-GCM encryption at rest", "logs retained for 365 days")
✓ Procedures with details ("reviewed quarterly by IT management", "approved by CISO", "penetration tests conducted annually by Acme Security")
✓ Organizational structures ("managed by 8-person IT team", "overseen by VP of Security", "performed by AWS as subservice organization")
✓ Technical configurations ("TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy", "bcrypt password hashing with cost factor 12", "daily incremental backups at 2 AM UTC")
✓ Compliance assertions ("meets NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5", "follows ISO 27001:2013", "complies with GDPR Article 32")
✓ Quantitative metrics ("RTO of 4 hours", "RPO of 15 minutes", "99.95% uptime SLA", "maximum 3 failed login attempts")

WHAT TO SKIP:
✗ Document metadata ("This is a SOC2 report", "Examination period was...")
✗ Legal boilerplate ("Confidential information", "Trade secrets", "Not for distribution")
✗ Table of contents items
✗ Page numbers or section headers alone
