The extraction patterns module successfully:
✓ Extracts frequencies (daily, quarterly, every N days)
✓ Extracts sample sizes (inspected N, sampled N out of M)
✓ Extracts durations (90 days, 24 hours, etc.)
✓ Extracts percentages and thresholds (99.95%, >80%)
✓ Extracts technical specs (TLS 1.3, AES-256, multi-factor auth)
✓ Extracts roles (IT Security team, CISO, Security Administrator)
✓ Parses control table rows
✓ Calculates accurate specificity scores

Next steps:
1. Integrate into fact_extractor.py
2. Update extraction prompts to use structured templates
3. Re-run extraction on SOC2 document
4. Measure improvement: target 8-12 facts/100 lines (currently 2.85)
