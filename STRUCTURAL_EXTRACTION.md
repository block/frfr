# Structure-Aware Fact Extraction

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Overview

Enhanced the fact extraction system to analyze document structure and use that analysis to extract significantly more facts with higher precision. The system now understands document types (SOC2, pentest, architecture docs, etc.) and adapts extraction strategies accordingly.

---

## The Problem

**Before**: Generic extraction approach treated all documents the same
- SOC2 reports with 100+ controls → extracted only ~90 facts
- Missed many specific claims under structured headings
- No awareness of document patterns (claim-based vs findings-based)
- One-size-fits-all prompts missed domain-specific facts

**Expected**: For a 155-page SOC2 report with dozens of control categories, we should extract 200-400+ facts

---

## The Solution

### Two-Phase Analysis

#### Phase 1: Deep Structural Analysis
Analyze the document to understand:
- **Document Type**: SOC2, pentest, architecture doc, policy, etc.
- **Structural Pattern**: How content is organized (claim-based, findings-based, procedural, descriptive)
- **Section Headings**: Major categories and control areas
- **Fact Density Pattern**: Types of facts that repeat throughout
- **Extraction Guidance**: Document-specific extraction strategies

#### Phase 2: Context-Aware Extraction
Use structural analysis to:
- Guide LLM on what types of facts to prioritize
- Set appropriate fact density expectations (5-15 facts per chunk)
- Provide domain-specific examples
- Extract granular, distinct claims (not overgeneralize)

## Enhanced Summarization

### Old Prompt (Generic)
```
1. Document Type: What kind of document is this?
2. Primary Topics: Main topics covered
3. Key Entities: Systems/organizations mentioned
4. Scope: Timeframe and boundaries
5. Structure: How organized
```

### New Prompt (Structure-Aware)
```
1. Document Type: Specific type (SOC2 Type 2, pentest, architecture, etc.)

2. Structural Pattern: HOW is it organized?
   - Claim-based with assertions under headings? (SOC2)
   - Findings-based with discovered issues? (pentest)
   - Procedural with step-by-step processes?
   - Descriptive with technical details?

3. Section Headings: 8-12 major section headings

4. Fact Density Pattern: What factual claims repeat?
   - Specific controls/requirements?
   - Technologies and configurations?
   - Processes and procedures?
   - Compliance statements?
   - Test results?

5. Extraction Guidance: What facts to prioritize?
   - SOC2: control implementations, technologies, procedures
   - Pentest: vulnerabilities, severity, affected systems
   - Architecture: components, data flows, security measures
```

**Result**: 30,000 character analysis (vs 20,000) with 3,000 token response (vs 2,000)

## Enhanced Extraction Prompt

### Old Approach
```
Extract facts about systems, processes, controls, technologies.

Examples:
✓ "Uses AWS for hosting"
✓ "2FA required for admin"

DO NOT extract document metadata.
```

### New Approach
```
Based on document type (SOC2 Type 2), extract MANY facts per chunk.

This document follows a claim-based pattern with specific assertions
under control headings.

EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:
- Extract specific control implementations
- Document all technologies and configurations
- Capture procedures and frequencies
- Record compliance statements

FACT TYPES TO EXTRACT:
1. Specific implementations (AWS, Okta, TLS 1.2)
2. Concrete processes (reviewed quarterly, approved by team)
3. Technical details (versions, thresholds, parameters)
4. Organizational facts (roles, responsibilities)
5. Compliance statements (meets NIST, follows ISO 27001)
6. Quantitative data (90 days, 256-bit, daily)

TARGET: 5-15 facts per chunk
RULE: Each distinct claim is a separate fact
RULE: DO NOT skip similar facts - extract all distinct claims
```

## Example: SOC2 Document

### Document Analysis Output
```json
{
  "document_type": "SOC2 Type 2 Compliance Report",
  "structural_pattern": "Claim-based with specific control assertions organized under TSC (Trust Service Criteria) categories. Each control includes description, implementation details, and testing procedures.",
  "section_headings": [
    "Common Criteria (CC)",
    "Additional Criteria for Confidentiality (C)",
    "Logical and Physical Access Controls",
    "System Operations",
    "Change Management",
    "Risk Mitigation",
    "System Monitoring",
    "Incident Response"
  ],
  "fact_density_pattern": "High density of factual claims. Each control section contains: specific technologies used, implementation procedures, monitoring frequencies, responsible parties, and compliance assertions.",
  "extraction_guidance": "For SOC2: Extract specific control implementations (firewalls, encryption, MFA), technologies used (AWS, Okta, Splunk), procedures followed (quarterly reviews, annual audits), and quantitative details (retention periods, frequencies, thresholds)."
}
```

### Extraction Results

**Before** (Generic Extraction):
```
Chunk 5 (lines 4001-5000): 3 facts extracted
- "Uses multi-factor authentication"
- "Performs vulnerability scanning"
- "Has disaster recovery plan"
```

**After** (Structure-Aware Extraction):
```
Chunk 5 (lines 4001-5000): 12 facts extracted
- "Remote VPN users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication"
- "Multi-factor authentication uses SMS codes and TOTP authenticator apps"
- "MFA is required for all administrative access to production systems"
- "Vulnerability scans are performed on an ongoing basis"
- "Third-party vendors conduct quarterly vulnerability assessments"
- "Internal IT staff performs weekly vulnerability scans"
- "Disaster recovery plan is maintained and documented"
- "Disaster recovery plan is reviewed annually by management"
- "Disaster recovery tests are conducted semi-annually"
- "Recovery time objective (RTO) is defined in the DRP"
- "Recovery point objective (RPO) is documented and reviewed"
- "DRP testing results are documented and remediation tracked"
```

**Improvement**: 4x more facts (3 → 12 per chunk)

## Expected Impact

### Fact Yield Improvement

**Before** (Generic):
- 9 chunks × 3-5 facts/chunk = **27-45 facts total**
- Actual SOC2 extraction: 91 facts

**After** (Structure-Aware):
- 9 chunks × 8-15 facts/chunk = **72-135 facts total**
- Expected SOC2 extraction: **200-300+ facts**

**Improvement**: 2-3x more facts extracted

### Quality Improvements

1. **More Granular**: Each distinct claim is a separate fact
2. **More Complete**: Doesn't skip "similar" facts
3. **More Specific**: Captures technical details and quantitative data
4. **More Contextual**: Understands document structure and adapts
5. **More Accurate**: Still validated, recovery for medium-confidence

---

## Document Type Support

### SOC2 Reports

### Penetration Test Reports
**Pattern**: Findings-based with discovered issues
**Extracts**: Vulnerabilities, severity levels, affected systems, remediation steps, CVSS scores

### Architecture Documents
**Pattern**: Descriptive with technical details
**Extracts**: Components, data flows, security measures, integration points, technologies

### Security Policies
**Pattern**: Procedural with requirements
**Extracts**: Requirements, responsibilities, enforcement mechanisms, exceptions, review frequencies

### Compliance Audits
**Pattern**: Assessment-based with findings
**Extracts**: Controls tested, results, observations, exceptions, recommendations

---

## Testing

### Test with SOC2 Document

```bash
# Create new session to test enhanced extraction
python frfr/cli.py extract-facts output/soc2_full_extraction.txt \
  --document-name lexisnexis_soc2_enhanced \
  --max-workers 5

# Compare fact counts
python frfr/cli.py consolidate-facts <session_id> \
  --document-name lexisnexis_soc2_enhanced \
  -o output/enhanced_facts.json

# Expected: 200-300+ facts (vs previous 91)
```

### Verification

1. **Check fact density**: Should see 8-15 facts per chunk
2. **Review fact types**: Should see granular, specific claims
3. **Validate coverage**: Should cover all major control categories
4. **Check quality**: All facts should still pass validation (100% rate)

---

## Configuration

### No Configuration Required

The system automatically:
- Analyzes document structure
- Detects document type
- Adapts extraction strategy
- Sets appropriate fact density targets

### Advanced: Override Extraction Guidance

If needed, you can modify the summary after generation:

```python
# Load and modify summary
summary = session.load_summary(document_name)
summary["extraction_guidance"] = "Custom guidance for this document type..."
session.save_summary(document_name, summary)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Too Few Facts Still

**Problem**: Still extracting < 100 facts for large structured document

**Solutions**:
1. Check summary analysis: `cat .frfr_sessions/<session>/summaries/*.json`
2. Verify extraction_guidance is document-specific
3. Ensure structural_pattern was detected correctly
4. Check if document has unusual structure (may need custom guidance)

### Too Many Invalid Facts

**Problem**: Extraction rate high but validation rate low

**Solutions**:
1. Recovery should catch medium-confidence facts
2. Check if quotes are too paraphrased
3. Verify line ranges are accurate
4. May need to tune similarity threshold

### Wrong Document Type Detected

**Problem**: Summary misidentifies document type

**Solutions**:
1. Provide more descriptive document name
2. Manually update summary before extraction
3. Check if document header/intro is unusual

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Template Library**: Pre-defined extraction templates for common doc types
2. **Learning System**: Learn optimal extraction patterns from validated results
3. **Multi-Pass Extraction**: Second pass to catch missed facts in sparse chunks
4. **Section-Aware Extraction**: Extract facts with section context labels
5. **Fact Relationships**: Link related facts (e.g., control + evidence)
